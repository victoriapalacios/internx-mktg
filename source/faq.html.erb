      <div class="faq-c">
        <div class="faq-q"><span class="faq-t">+</span>What if I already have an internship, co-op, or full-time job lined up?</div>
        <div class="faq-a">
          <p>Don’t have FOMO – fear of missing out. You can still make a profile, and you can still get paid even if you already committed to a company.  Our goal is to get you the best offer from the best company.  Don’t let prior commitments get in the way of your dream job.</p>

      <div class="faq-c">
        <div class="faq-q"><span class="faq-t">+</span>Why should I make a profile if I want to go to grad school?</div>
        <div class="faq-a">
          <p>Because graduate programs recruit students just like companies do (career fairs and resume books). Get contacted directly from elite graduate programs.</p>
        </div>

      <div class="faq-c">
        <div class="faq-q"><span class="faq-t">+</span>Can you explain this whole getting paid to be on your platform thing?</div>
        <div class="faq-a">
          <p>Recruiters can only access your contact info when they save your profile to their cart. You get paid $1 each time that happens. <br>Whether you’re an undergraduate computer science student or a master’s art major, the odds are that your broke college student wallet wouldn’t mind some extra cushioning – so we wanted to reward you for your hard work in school and give you extra money for your slush fund.</p>

      <div class="faq-c">
        <div class="faq-q"><span class="faq-t">+</span>How will recruiters contact me?</div>
        <div class="faq-a">
          <p>They’ll most likely send you an email. We just provide them your student email and let them contact you when they’re ready to be exposed to your talent. We’ve talked with recruiters about having a messaging service on our site, but recruiters prefer your email. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯  </p>

      <div class="faq-c">
        <div class="faq-q"><span class="faq-t">+</span>Am I going to get spammed with emails?</div>
        <div class="faq-a">
          <p>Not likely. We limit the amount of student profiles that companies can view so they don’t mass email an entire school. The idea is that companies only reach out if you seem like their ideal candidate. If you’re a beyond stellar student, you might get quite a few emails and make quite a bit of money in the process. Just embrace the rockstar status.</p>

      <div class="faq-c">
        <div class="faq-q"><span class="faq-t">+</span>Where should I send my transcript?</div>
        <div class="faq-a">
          <p>Save trees, and email digital transcripts to transcripts@theinternx.com. If your school is still in the Dark Ages, mail transcripts to 220 W Huron St #2001, Chicago, IL 60654.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-c">
        <div class="faq-q"><span class="faq-t">+</span>What if my school charges me a BS fee for sending an official transcript?</div>
        <div class="faq-a">
          <p>That’s cool.  If you get 5 friends to register, then we’ll reimburse you for your transcript fee.</p>
        </div>

      <div class="faq-c">
        <div class="faq-q"><span class="faq-t">+</span>What if I’ve already graduated?</div>
        <div class="faq-a">
          <p>Our platform is only for students that are currently enrolled in a college or university.  We’re working on making this platform available to recent graduates so stay tuned.</p>

        <div class="faq-q"><span class="faq-t">+</span>What happens to my account after I graduate?</div>
        <div class="faq-a">
          <p>We press the “delete” button on your profile. Sorry, not sorry.</p>
